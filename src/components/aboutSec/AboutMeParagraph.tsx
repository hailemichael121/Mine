      I like solving problems in software development, mostly in full-stack apps
      and front-end work. I use Python, Java, React, and Angular in my projects,
      and I build responsive and efficient web applications. Outside of work I
      keep learning and trying new tech. I enjoy improving and building better
      work step by step.
